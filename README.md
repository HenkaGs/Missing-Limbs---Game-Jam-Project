Missing Limbs
We made this game for the Games Now! Game Jam - Autumn 2023.

Your limbs are missing and you need to collect them throughout the game. Our primary objective was to illustrate how, sometimes we lose ourselves in our daily life routines, forgetting our origins, overlooking what we have missed, and underestimating our achievements. It's akin to losing certain aspects of ourselves in both our past and present, often without awareness in our waking lives. The game explores the idea that the only space where we recollect these missing parts of self (limbs as symbols of these parts) and commence the search for them is in our dreams, an experience that is not always appealing and sometimes can be weird and unpleasant.
